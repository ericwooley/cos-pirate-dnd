## Eye of Regret
Very very beautiful red ruby the size of half my fist on the top of a staff

* 1/day I can mind travel, only to places i have been before (where i have literally walked, retrace footsteps)
* takes 10 minutes to cast
* When I am there i can see/hear/smell
* gives advantage on remember lore
* Just observe

Nothing went wrong after looking into the bar for 20 minutes
